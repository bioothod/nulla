nulla (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * sample: parse and store whole track metadata each time parse_track() is called, since it updates video frame rate and possibly other fields
  * extract_meta: try stream reader, if it fails, use whole-file reader
  * sample: serialize track as array, this will allow us to extend it by changing embedded version number
  * iso_reader: added streaming ISO reader which accepts data chunks
  * license: added copyright note
  * Use GPL3 license
  * upload: fixed CORS by setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to wildcard '*'
  * config: log some headers
  * server: implemented /upload/ handler which selects bucket and uploads data reading data in chunks, it returns json object which tells where and how file has been stored
  * log: moved logger into own header
  * index.html: added links to initialize stream if autodetection failed
